                <h2>Roly Poly</h2>
             <p>Piper is a somewhat passive and needy - but very cute - cat.  Roly poly is her go-to move when she wants attention. It's not hard to spot the beginning of a roly poly. First the head tucks.  Next the body rolls.  Once on her back, she is ready to be petted.  Rolling side to side ensures that you don't miss critical spots. If she feels like maximizing cuteness, she tucks and crosses her front paws.</p>

                 <p>Unfortunately, she hasn't modified head tucking for hard floors. She needs to tuck her head more when off the carpet.  It's hard on her human family members to hear the thud over and over.  Thankfully, these "concussions" don't appear to cause any lasting damage.  Then again, why hasn't she learned?</p>
