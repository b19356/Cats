                <h2>Manspreader</h2>
             <p>Charlie is a curious young boy around two years old. His hobbies include taking up as much space as possible, begging for food, and clumsily sprinting into the bathtub.</p>
                
                 <p>He is sociable and enjoys the company of all humans. However, Charlie demands your full attention, and anything less is absolutely unacceptable. On days when you are unable to grant him constant recognition, he can be found yowling from the top of the refrigerator. It's also important to balance living up to his high expectations while being careful not to fulfill his every desire. For example, Charlie asserts that he should be fed at least four times daily, but his lavish lifestyle has led to an increasingly chubby belly.</p>
                
                <p>Below you will find evidence of Charlie's manspreading. Manspreading, although not illegal, is often terribly inconsiderate. </p>
