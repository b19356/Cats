                <h2>Upside Down</h2>
                <p>Beanie has become the poor recipient of my maternal instincts now that we are empty nesters. She is definitely my spoiled baby.</p>

                <p>I can think of two really cute things about Beanie. She covers her eyes when she sleeps with her marshmallow mitt paw – see picture. She also seems to be fascinated by being carried up-side down. I imagine when I hold her upside down she’s thinking “Wow, it looks really different from here!” . She almost seems to like being carried upside down. </p>

                <p>Other family members tell me I should stop contributing to Beanie’s obesity problem by giving her a can of Fancy Feast each day. To them I say, hey, cats are cute fatter!</p>
